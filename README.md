# Wack a Mole

New version of the game I developed during my bootcamp at Ironhack. At that time I developed the website using the DOM manipulation with Vanilla JS.

You can find here the original [repo](https://github.com/albacardona/Whack-a-mole) and the [demo](https://albacardona.github.io/Whack-a-mole/).

Four years after finishing the bootcamp, with a bit more experience, I have decided to redo the whole game using the stack in which I have developed the most: React and Typescript.
For styling, I used the CSS framework Tailwind CSS.

Other than that, the rules of the game are the same:
Use your mouse to whack the moles that will peep out randomly. Before starting, select the  **speed**  and the  **time**  of the game.

**Warning!!!**

The crazy level might be too fast, don't worry if you don't get any point at the end of the round.
